# TG-Liza

This is an attempt to put Eliza on a Vercel lambda function. As the Eliza codebase is like spaghetti, (and as usual working with some of the usual web3 devs who like to ship things before they are even ready), trying to put the workable parts (plus the Supabase db part) into vercel.

Wish me luck.
